Hi, I'm a Computer Science Student, the vast majority of these repositories are works done or in process of being done for university activities. The rest are projects to find out more about a particular tool.

**I invite you to know more about my works.**

My knowledge of most programming languages is not very great, but I know or have used them in the last two years, in order of knowledge:
- Python (Flask/FastAPI, Pandas, Matplotlib, Selenium, Numpy e Scikit-Learn);
- Java/Kotlin (Spring Boot);
- JavaScript/TypeScript;
- C#;
- VB .net;
- Julia;
- C++;
- Assebly (MIPS 32Bits);
- C.

I also know how to deal with git, HTML/CSS (including Bootstrap framework) and SQL (mainly the MySQL and SQLite database). 

My native language is portuguese, but my english is advanced and I'm in the process of learning german, currently I know the basics of it.
